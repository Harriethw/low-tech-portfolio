              as part of my <a href="https://containermagazine.co.uk/can-a-website-be-a-garden/">residency with Container Magazine and Control Shift</a>,
              I built my own little simple web server to host my own websites.
              It runs on a Raspberry Pi and uses an Apache server.
            </p>
            <p>
              even though I'd been a software engineer for quite a few years, I
              didn't know much about what setting up a server on my own might
              entail.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've collated the basic steps that I found helpful here because I
              couldn't find one resource that had everything I needed - it's
              cobbled together from different sources and I hope to expand on it
              so that it's not just a step-by-step guide, but also an explainer
              for people who might not know all the lingo used.
            </p>
            <p>
              so, if you've every wanted to build your own server on a raspberry
              pi, check out this instruction guide! Available in a regular PDF
              or one that you can print and fold up:
